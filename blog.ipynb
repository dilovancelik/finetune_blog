    "# Realistic approach to Finetuning in an enterprise environment\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a lot of development in the natural language processing space, especially since ChatGPT was introduced by OpenAI, it seems like a lot of ressources are being spent making LLMs better, and as they become better, people have been improving other things as well such as embeddings. This means \n",
    "However I live in a small country (Denmark), with a small language with around 6 million people speaking the language, even if we are really generous and clump together Norwegian, Danish and Swedish went is only around 22 million speakers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a big company or organisation who plans on training the next opensource model you’ll probably chose a bigger language like French, German or Spanish. And even if you are choosing train a multilingual model, there is a big chance, that danish will only be in a small fraction of the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously I've written about embeddings, and how they can be tool for you as a data engineer [Teaching a machine to read, how LLM's comprehend text](https://dilovan.substack.com/p/teaching-a-machine-to-read-how-llms). However if you cannot find a good embedding model for your data, it won’t help you that much. Therefore we need to solve this problem.aAs I see it there are two approaches to handle this. The first is to translate your documents to a bigger language like English. This approach has a lot of drawbacks, first the process of translating can be ressource intensive, and even more important, we loose a lot of information in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach, is to fine-tune our model with our own data. I personally believe, this to be a much better approach. First we can increase the performance by quite a lot, second we are not just making the model better at working with danish text. We are making the model work better with our Danish text. Let’s say we have a lot of contracts we want to embed, the type of language used would be different than if we were embedding code documentation, or clinical records. I fine-tuned model will given the same ressources, perform better than a generalised one. Since it has had more time training on the type of data which is important to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part I will go through the steps you need to complete to get to the fine-tuning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important things when finetuning data, would be to gather data. But before we start data gathering, we need to think about what we are building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you are building an application where you can send in a list of symptoms and retrieve the 10 most likely diagnoses. In this case we want a model which can match the embedding of the list of symptoms with the embeddings of the diagnosis. If on the other hand we wanted a model which could retrieve the applicabale laws when given a user questions. We would need to train our model to match the questions to the applicable law. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will create a model which can take a subject (Crime, Unemployment, Climate Change) and match it with public speeches made by the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \n",
    "I have a folder with a 153 speeches by the Prime Minister. But because the speeches can be on a lot of different subjects I will need to break it into chunks. The naive way of doing this would be to just break it into an even number of characters (lets say 1.000) with some overlap between chunks. This can work really well. \n",
    "However I would encourage you to look at your data to see if there are any natural breaks, you can use for chunking. For instance if we were working with laws, we might chose to put each article into a chunk. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I look through my data, I noticed that for longer speeches lines like * * * * or - - - - would be inserted as a seperator between different sections. I could therefor use this as a delimiter. For speeches where this wasn't the case, I would just use the naive approachm but chunk by lines instead of characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code is what I used to chunk my data."

This means we need not just the chunks, but the user input in this case different subjects. Since we do not have the user input, we need to generate them. This could be done manually by going through the chunks and carefully annotating all of them. This approach would definitely give the best result, however it would take up way to much time. Instead we'll generate synthetic data using an LLM. For this case we will use phi4 from microsoft running in ollama on my local machine. I've chosen this model because I believe it has a good tradeoff between compute and result. But test out different models for yourself. The approach to generate this data, is to feed the model with a chunk of text, and ask it to generate the subjects. \n",

For the type of finetunning we want to do, it is very common to organise your data into triplets.
